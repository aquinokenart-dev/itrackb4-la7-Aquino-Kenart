Lab #3 
Q1. Explain the order you placed your featured route and your detail route in, and what would happen if you swapped them.
-I put the featured route before the detail route because Laravel might think featured is an ID if the detail route comes first.

Q2. What happens when someone visits an id that does not exist in your data, and what did you write to make that happen?
-If the ID does not exist, it shows a 404 error. I used abort(404) to do this.

Q3.Why do your links use route names instead of typed URLs? Give one concrete thing that would break if they did not.
-I used route names to make the links easier. If I change the URL, the links can still work.
